#### **My tutorial review:**

-   This was a good tutorial demonstrating realistic practices but still beginner friendly. Maybe the CSS could have been more organised to make media queries more efficient. Not sure if having to adjust a lot of code within media queries is normal though.
-   All in all, I did learn a lot of new concepts and techniques, and got a good idea of some common best practices

#### **Topics Learnt:**

-   Used Google's material icons
-   Used semantic html tags
-   Used variables to set colors and styles globally
-   Used relative units (rem)
-   Used Grid layout
-   Used css gap property
-   Used custom svg (+ circle)
-   Used table in html
-   Used pseudoelements (:before, :last-child)
-   Used media queries
-   Used JS to animate sidebar in mobile view and to toggle between themes
-   Added table data dynamically using JS

#### **Areas needing improvement:**

-   Grid layout
-   stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset
-   Practice making tables in html and to use css properties with it
-   Learn how to make tags within tables
-   Practice using pseudoelements
-   Need to learn how to organise css properly and efficiently use of media queries for a responsive design
-   Practice CSS animations
-   Need to practice JS DOM manipulation

#### **Some Key Take aways:**

-   I can see the need to have a design system in place to fast track the front-end design process.
-   I can also see the downside of using vanilla CSS. Something like Sass adds extended functionality to CSS and it seems very useful to learn it.
-   It is actually very time consuming to code all this frontend code from scratch! It took me one full day to complete this tutorial! I am hoping, though, learning tailwindCSS and react.JS might help me save on time.
