## About this tutorial:

-   Project is good for learning but not suitable for real life applications
-   Although title says its is responsive, the author is using absolute units (like px) rather than relative units (like em/rem/%)
-   The markup uses lots of div tags, doesn't utilise html5 semantic tags, i.e. not following industry best practices.

## What I learned:

-   Using position absolute vs relative
-   Javascript toggle function
-   Discovered and used boxicon for Icons - they have a really good collection of common icons and it's very simple to use.

## Improvements I can make:

-   Still need more understanding and practice on position property
-   Need to understand z-index properly
