## What I learned:

- How to add interactivity (like hover states) on SVG - only possible with inline svg
- Difference between viewBox and viewPort in SVG's
- CSS Specificity and how its calculated.

## Improvements I can make:

- Need to understand flex-box / grid layouts more to be able to create truly responsive designs.
- Need to understand differences between the CSS 'display' property values.
- Need to understand differences between the CSS 'background attachment' property values.
- Need more practice more.
