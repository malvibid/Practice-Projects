## What I learned:

-   Used media queries. (But didn't really stop to understand, I just borrowed from previous projects I have completed)
-   Used positon absolute for footer. But this would not be ideal if there was more content. In that case, what is the best practice? Idk

## Improvements I can make:

-   I just tried to complete this project as quickly as possible with whatever I could think of first. I didn't try to use best practices in this project.
-   Need more practice more.
-   Need to understand how to create responsive designs.
